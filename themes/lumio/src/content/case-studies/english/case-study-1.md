A production-deployed, full-stack decentralized application built for the Polkadot Alumni Hackathon. InkTix is a cross-chain ticket marketplace on Westend Asset Hub addressing scalping, fraud, and pricing opacity through on-chain enforcement. Rust 58.4%, TypeScript 35.7%.

## Smart Contract Layer [.text-h4]

The ink! 5.1.1 contract implements 52 message handlers across a unified `InkTixStorage` structure with 100+ mapping fields. Core capabilities:

- **Dynamic pricing** — 6-factor algorithm incorporating demand, time-to-event, seat classification, team performance, rivalry weight, and season pass status
- **Anti-scalping enforcement** — configurable purchase limits per wallet, transfer cooldowns, and a hard 1.5× resale price cap enforced at the contract level
- **NFT ticket minting and verification** — Blake2x256 hashes with QR code integration for on-chain ownership and authenticity
- **Multi-currency payments** — DOT, KSM, aUSD, ACA, and LDOT with on-chain exchange rates
- **XCM cross-chain transfers** — `limitedReserveTransferAssets` to destination parachains
- **Group purchasing** — shared codes generating 5% discounts with adjacent seating allocation
- **Domain-specific features** — sports (teams, seasons, fantasy leagues) and concert (artist management) modules

## Frontend and Integration [.text-h4]

- Next.js 15.5, React 19.1, TypeScript 5.9, Zustand 5.0 with persistence middleware
- @polkadot/api 16.4 + @polkadot/api-contract 16.5 with Polkadot.js, Talisman, and SubWallet support
- Analytics dashboard — platform KPIs, revenue visualization, and demand heatmaps
- Docker Compose local dev environment with substrate-contracts-node

## Testing and Quality [.text-h4]

- 14 contract unit tests via `cargo test`
- 31 frontend unit tests (Vitest 3.2 + Testing Library 16.3)
- 3 Playwright 1.58 end-to-end specifications
- GitHub Actions CI/CD — contract tests + lint/build/test on every push
